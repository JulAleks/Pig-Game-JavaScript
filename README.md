# Pig-Game-JavaScript
 This GitHub repository hosts a JavaScript-based Simple Dice Pig Game, adding a twist to the classic Pig rules with two dice. Players roll to accumulate points, but a single 1 ends the turn, while double 1s wipe out their entire score. Enjoy interactive gaming with a user-friendly interface!
